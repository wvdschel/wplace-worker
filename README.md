# wplace-worker

A totally rule-abiding, read only monitoring tool for [wplace](https://wplace.live) accounts. Definitely doesn't draw pixels. It wouldn't dare.

# Features

- [x] Multi-account support
- [x] Automatic palette conversion (but it looks bad)
- [x] CLI interface for monitoring progress
- [x] Web interface for monitoring progress
- [x] CloudFlare bypass (using [CloudBuster](https://github.com/wvdschel/cloudbuster))

# TODO:

- [ ] Automatic droplet spending on upgrades
- [ ] Premium color support
- [ ] Draws outlines first (currently supports only scanline like drawing)
